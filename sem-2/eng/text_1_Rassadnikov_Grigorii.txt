Dear Mr. and Mrs. Conway, 
My name is Grigorii Rassadnikov and I come from Saint-Petersburg. Thank you for offering to be my homestay family, when I'm in Canberra.
I am 18 years old and I study at Itmo University in Saint-Petersburg. I live alone in flat. My mother is a commercial director in a construction company. I've got a sister, she live with mother and study at school. 
In my free time, I like play hockey with my family. We really like this activity and we usually take part in "friendly" matches every Saturday.
While I'm in Canberra, I want to study hard and improve my English, because I want to become a programmer. I don't dream of living abroad, but I understand that knowledge of English is very important for my future job.
I'm looking forward to meeting you when I arrive. 
Best wishes, 
Grigorii
