When, I was in high school, my grandfather bought me and my cousin two new motorcycles. Grandpa and my uncle taught us how to drive. After that, my uncle bought a motorcycle for himself and my sister. We started driving together. In the summer we took part in the races.
We usually ride in forest, fields and explore new routes. We really like this activity. I think, that and you should try to ride by motorcycles and take part in the races. But this activity can be very dangerous, so you should observe safety precautions, buy special equipment and upgrade your driving skills.
